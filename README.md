## Overview

Kafka is a powerful distributed event streaming platform. Monitoring its configurations is crucial for maintaining performance and reliability. The Kafka Config Metrics Exporter provides an easy way to gather these metrics and send them to Prometheus for visualization and alerting.

## Features

- **Simple Setup**: Get started quickly with minimal configuration.
- **Prometheus Integration**: Seamlessly export metrics to Prometheus.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Keep an eye on your Kafka configurations in real-time.
- **Custom Dashboards**: Create dashboards tailored to your monitoring needs.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the Kafka Config Metrics Exporter, download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/kireeti368/kafka-config-metrics/releases). Once downloaded, follow the instructions to execute the file.

### Configuration

Before running the exporter, you need to configure it to connect to your Kafka instance. Create a configuration file with the following structure:

```yaml
kafka:
  bootstrap_servers: "localhost:9092"
  topic: "your-topic"
  group_id: "your-group-id"
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual Kafka server details.

## Usage

After configuring the exporter, you can run it with the following command:

```bash
./kafka-config-metrics-exporter --config your-config-file.yaml
```

Make sure to replace `your-config-file.yaml` with the path to your actual configuration file.

## Metrics

The exporter collects various metrics related to Kafka configurations, including:

- **Broker Configurations**: Metrics related to broker settings.
- **Topic Configurations**: Information about topic-level settings.
- **Consumer Group Configurations**: Metrics about consumer group settings.

These metrics can be visualized in Prometheus and used to create alerts.

## Dashboard Setup

To visualize the metrics collected by the Kafka Config Metrics Exporter, set up a dashboard in Prometheus. Follow these steps:

1. Open your Prometheus UI.
2. Add the Kafka Config Metrics Exporter as a data source.
3. Create a new dashboard and add panels for the metrics you want to monitor.

For detailed instructions on setting up dashboards, refer to the [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/dashboard/).
